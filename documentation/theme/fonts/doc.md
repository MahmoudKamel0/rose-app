## Fonts: WOFF2 Format

### Overview
The project uses **WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format 2)** — the latest and most optimized web font format.  
It’s designed specifically for modern browsers to improve loading speed, reduce bandwidth usage, and enhance overall performance.

### Why WOFF2?
1. Compression Efficiency: WOFF2 uses advanced Brotli compression, resulting in up to 
   `30% smaller file size` compared to WOFF and TTF formats. 

2. Better Performance: Smaller file sizes mean **faster font loading** and reduced render-blocking time,
   which improves page performance and Core Web Vitals. 

3. Modern Browser Support: Supported by all major browsers — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. 

4. Reduced Bandwidth Usage: Helps minimize network requests and bandwidth consumption, especially on 
   slow or mobile networks. |

5. Optimized for Web Use: Unlike TTF or OTF, WOFF2 is built specifically for web delivery — it 
   strips unnecessary metadata and focuses purely on rendering efficiency. |
