# Image Optimization & Performance Enhancement

## Overview  
As part of the performance optimization process for the project, all images have been converted to the modern WebP format.  
This change significantly reduces file sizes without losing visual quality — resulting in faster load times, better Core Web Vitals, and improved SEO.

## What Was Done
1. Conversion to WebP: All existing JPG and PNG images were converted to .webp format using lossless    
   compression techniques.

2. Renamed with Descriptive Names: Every image file has been renamed using clear, human-readable names 
   (e.g., rose-bouquet.webp, delivery-van.webp).

3. Clean Folder Structure: Images are now organized by purpose and type.

## Performance Benefits
   - Improved LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) — Pages load visibly faster.  
   - Reduced Bandwidth Usage — Optimized for mobile and slow networks.  
   - Better SEO Rankings — Google prioritizes performance-friendly sites.  
   - Enhanced UX — Users experience smoother, quicker navigation.

## Tools & Workflow
   - Used professional tools like Squoosh, TinyPNG, and Sharp for conversion.  
   - Verified compression results with Lighthouse and WebPageTest.  
   - Maintained full visual fidelity using lossless WebP compression.

## Summary
By converting all images to WebP, renaming them meaningfully, and structuring the folders logically,  
the app now loads faster, consumes fewer resources, and delivers a **premium, optimized user experience**.
